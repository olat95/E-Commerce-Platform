==============================================
SUMMARY
==============================================
Total Images: 8
Total Size: 0B (0 bytes)
Average Size: 0B
Total Layers: 0
Average Layers: 0

==============================================
OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS
==============================================

1. Use Alpine Linux base images (node:18-alpine vs node:18)
2. Multi-stage builds to exclude build dependencies
3. Combine RUN commands to reduce layers
4. Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files
5. Clear package manager cache after installation
6. Use specific package versions
7. Minimize number of COPY/ADD instructions
8. Order Dockerfile from least to most frequently changed

==============================================
OPTIMIZATION POTENTIAL
==============================================
Current Total Size: 0B
Expected After Optimization: 0B
Potential Savings: 0B (50% reduction)

Next Steps:
1. Review Dockerfiles for each service
2. Implement multi-stage builds
3. Switch to Alpine base images
4. Update .dockerignore files
5. Run optimization build script
6. Compare results with this baseline
